#Exercise 3.4. A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For
#example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:
#def do_twice(f):
#f()
#f()
#Here’s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.
#def print_spam():
#print 'spam'
#do_twice(print_spam)

#	1. Type this example into a script and test it.
#	2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the
#	function twice, passing the value as an argument.
#	3. Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice, that takes a string as a
#	parameter and prints it twice.
#	4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an
#	argument.
#	5. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the
#	function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in
#	the body of this function, not four.

def do_twice(f,val):

	do_twice(print_twice,val)
